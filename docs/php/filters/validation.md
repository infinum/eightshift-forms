# Validation filters

This document will provide you with the code examples for forms filters used in validation.

## Force mimetype validation from filesystem values
By default, mime-types are validated from the filesystem mimetype.
However, in case the file is not present on the filesystem for any reason, this will fall back to the POST-provided mimetype.

Using this filter, you can force Eightshift Forms to fail every file upload where it can't validate the mimetype from the filesystem.

**Filter name:**
`es_forms_validation_force_mimetype_from_fs`

**Filter example:**
```php
// Force mimetype validation from FS
add_filter('es_forms_validation_force_mimetype_from_fs', [$this, 'forceMimetypeFs']);

/**
 * Force mimetype validation from FS.
 *
 * @return bool
 */
public function forceMimetypeFs(): bool
{
	return true;
}
```
